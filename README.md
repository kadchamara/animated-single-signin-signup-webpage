# Single web page that include Sign in and Sign up process.
<p>Usually, we used create Sign in and Sign up web pages differently. Then we used to link those together by adding small text or buttons. So I thought to give this little change and end up creating both the sign-in and sign-up process on a single web page. Here when the user has to choose whether he needs to sign in to his account or sign up for a new account. When the user chooses it you can see there is a small transformation. And lastly yes there is no refresh on the web page when the user chooses.</p>
